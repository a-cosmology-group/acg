## [Rejecting the Blurriness Criticism](./marmet_l/rejecting-the-blurriness-criticism.html)
**By Louis Marmet** - 2023 June 20

The "blurriness criticism of tired-light" assumes a single interaction that satisfies **conservation of energy and momentum** in non-expanding space, and a resulting photon propagating in the same direction as the initial photon.  It is applicable to Compton scattering and other tired-light models.

## [A Quantum Approach to Relativistic Cosmology](./keys_r/quantum-approach-to-relativistic-cosmology.pdf)
**By Roy Keys** - 2022 October 19

Cosmology is the branch of astrophysics concerned with the large-scale structure of the cosmos and (in the current interpretation) the origin of the universe. Yet science seeks to explain the world from a principle of conservation. If the universe had a beginning, then matter and motion, space and time, had to be created. This point of view is obviously incompatible with a principle of conservation. An alternative model is proposed to circumvent these difficulties, and an extension of general relativity theory is posited.

## [Did ‘Big Bang’ Really Happen?](./ghosh_a/did-big-bang-really-happen.pdf)
**by Amitabha Ghosh** - 2022 January 28

The basic nature of the universe--finite and evolving as a whole or infinite and quasi-static--is still not fully established, although mainstream scientists have accepted the standard ‘Big Bang’ model. Only a small group of people continues to struggle against this dogma, seeking to replace the standard model with an infinite quasi-static universe.

## [New Thermodynamics: Inelastic Collisions and Cosmology](https://doi.org/10.24018/ejphysics.2020.2.6.32)
**By Kent W. Mayhew** - 2020 December 1

The sciences have evolved around elastic collisions although most collisions are inelastic.  Inelastic collisions create photons.  This has led to consideration of an ensemble of inelastic collisions producing CMB.  This will further lead to brief discussions concerning the nature of dark matter, and dark energy.

## [Embarrassing blunders in Big Bang cosmology](./traunmueller/embarrassing-blunders-in-big-bang.pdf)
**by Hartmut Traunmüller** - 2020 November 15

In Big Bang cosmology, the universe expanded from a very dense, hot and opaque initial state. It became transparent when it had expanded for 380,000 years and cooled to about 3000 kelvins. At this stage, light was last scattered by elementary particles and released. The light waves were then further stretched by the expansion of the universe. They are now, 13.7 billion years later, about 1100 times longer. This is thought to have resulted in the observable thermal radiation with 2.7 kelvins – the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

But how can we even see this radiation if the matter of which we consist shares its origin with the light?

## [Book Review: The Cosmic Revolutionary's Handbook](./marmet_l/cosmic-revolutionary_marmet.html)
**By Louis Marmet** - 2020 August 24

Few cosmologists will want to admit this, but the Big Bang model is in desperate need of a revolution.  The Hubble tension exposes an inconsistency on the most fundamental assumption of expansion cosmology!

## [Galaxies and Explosions in the Eternal Universe](./santavuori_o/galaxies-and-explosions-in-the-eternal-universe.pdf)
**By Olli Santavuori** - 2020 April 7

The accelerating going away of the galaxies from the eyes of the observer happens because of the infinite – no edge – property of the universe. It does not mean the expansion of the space itself, as the Big Bang-theory concludes and supposes.

## [Big Bang Cosmology Funeral](.sorli_as/big-bang-cosmology-funeral_sorli.pdf)
** by A.S. Šorli** - 2020 March 4

Physics is built by measured data. Cosmology also should be built on measured data.

## [What I Learned by Reading Collingwood](./berrigan_p/what-i-learned-reading-collingwood_berrigan.html)
**By Pierre Berrigan** - 2020 February 27

  The term «metaphysics» has certainly been badly mistreated in the last few decades and has come to designate the lot of all types of weirdness, off-this-world and wacky ideas. As such, the entire discipline tends to be ridiculed and dismissed by scientists as useless and unintelligible nonsense, the makings of wild and unbridled imaginations, fruitless and endless arguing.

## [Cosmology Questions to ACG Members](./lerner_ej/cosmology-questions.html)
**By Eric J. Lerner** - 2020 January 29

  Trying to look at the questionnaire from a purely descriptive standpoint I would say this paragraph characterizes the agreements.

## [The Scientific Evidence Against the Big Bang](https://lppfusion.com/science/cosmic-connection/plasma-cosmology/the-growing-case-against-the-big-bang/)
**By Eric J. Lerner** - 2020 January 19

  The contradictions between Big Bang theory predictions and observations are not at all limited to those that have been widely dubbed a “Crisis in Cosmology”.  Despite the continuing popularity of the theory, essentially every prediction of the Big Bang theory has been increasingly contradicted by better and better data.  The real crisis in cosmology is that the Big Bang never happened.

## [Criteria for a Scientific Model: The measuring device as a physical concept](./marmet_l/criteria-for-a-scientific-model.html)
**By Louis Marmet** - 2019 December 13

Although it is difficult to reach agreement on a precise definition of the scientific method (*how* science is done), the distinction between physics and mathematics (*what* is science) should always be clear in the scientist's mind. Yet, [theoretical physicists have developed a habit of putting forward entirely baseless speculations](http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-crisis-in-physics-is-not-only-about.html).

## [Why can’t Cosmology be more open?](./narlikar_j/why-cant-cosmology-be-more-open.pdf)
**by Jayant Narlikar** - 2019 February 25

If there is no other independent support for assumptions, the entire structure becomes suspect.  The scientific approach then requires a critical re-examination of the basic paradigm.

## [A Philosophical Rejection of the Big Bang Theory](https://zenodo.org/record/3544779#.Xd1s25MzbIU)
**By Khuram Rafique** - 2018 February 11

In this book, original papers of Friedmann, Lemaître, Hubble, Einstein along with others have been analyzed and only the most fundamental aspects like expansion and CMBR of the Big Bang Cosmology are covered. If these two aspects of the Big Bang Cosmology are precisely refuted then there is nothing crucial left with the standard model.

## [Arp’s Indomitable Universe](./soares_dsl/arps-indomitable-universe.pdf)
**by Domingos S. L. Soares, Marcos C. D. Neves, Andre K. T. Assis** - 2017 May 25

We present some aspects of the work and personality of Halton Christian Arp (1927-2013).
Galaxies, like people, can be complicated and strange, and interact in a very peculiar way.
And that is what we shall deal with here – with such a complex and, to a degree, indomitable universe.
One of the first astronomers to embrace the “weird” galaxies was the American Halton Christian Arp.

## [Growing mass of evidence challenges “concordance cosmology” but elicits no response.](.lerner_ej/concordance-cosmology-challenged.pdf)
**by Eric Lerner and Richard Lieu** - 2009 July 9

In the past year, but particularly in the past three months, a growing number of astrophysical papers have revealed results that challenge the “precision cosmology” notion in fundamental ways.

## [New Results Challenge Big Bang theory at Portugal Conference](.lerner_ej/new-results-challenge-big-bang-at-ccc-1.pdf)
**by Eric Lerner, Jose Almeida, and Riccardo Scarpa** - 2005 July 1

Three dozen physicists and astronomers reviewed the evidence for and against the Big Bang theory of the universe and alternatives to it at the first Crisis in Cosmology Conference in Moncao, Portugal, June 23-25. The conference, organized by the Alternative Cosmology Group, was a response to a flood of new observations that challenge the predictions of the Big Bang, the dominant theory of cosmology, and that have led increasing numbers of astronomers to think that the field has entered a crisis.

## [First Crisis In Cosmology Conference](.lerner_ej/alternatives-to-big-bang-at-ccc-1.pdf)
**by Eric J. Lerner, Jose Almeida, and Riccardo Scarpa** - 2005 July 1

**CCC-I**  
Moncao, Portugal June 23-25

Astrophysicists gather to discuss new challenges and alternatives to the Big Bang.

The past year has brought more and more data from the cosmos that challenge the predictions of the Big Bang, the
dominant theory of cosmology. Increasing numbers of astronomers are thinking that the field has entered a crisis. To look
at the new data, examine the difficulties facing the Big Bang and to discuss entirely different views of the universe and its
history, including those without a Big Bang, some three dozen astrophysicists will converge on the village of Moncao,
Portugal for the First Crisis In Cosmology Conference June 23-25.
