# Web Content and Discussion Guidelines

*A Cosmology Group* draws its mandate from the [Open Letter to the Scientific Community](org/open-letter-on-cosmology.md) to engage scientists
in an open exchange of ideas beyond the framework of Standard Cosmology through a critical examination of the methods and investigations of cosmology.


## Ground rules concerning topics accepted on thee Group's GitHub repository

A Cosmology Group will only accept topics with a first-degree relationship with cosmology.

Topics in fundamental physics which may have some relevance to cosmology may be discussed in an [Essay](../essays/index.md) to establish if the link with cosmology is demonstrated or only speculative.


## Ground rules concerning the use of *Generative AI*

Following the lead of *Nature*[^1] and other major publishers[^2], *A Cosmology Group* will ***not accept*** 'generative AI' tools as credited authors on a research paper, nor output from such tools cited in papers or [`a-cosmology-group/discussions`](https://github.com/orgs/a-cosmology-group/discussions).

'Generative AI' produces patterns of words based on statistical correlations in their training data and text provided by users, producing an output that appears like normal language but that may contain fundamental errors.  Furthermore, 'language models' cannot provide references for their output, which is counter to the principles of scientific research.[^3]
