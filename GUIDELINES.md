# Web Content and Discussion Guidelines

*A Cosmology Group* draws its mandate from the [Open Letter to the Scientific Community](essays/open-letter-on-cosmology.md) to engage scientists
in an open exchange of ideas beyond the framework of Standard Cosmology through a critical examination of the methods and investigations of cosmology.


## Ground rules concerning the use of *Generative AI*

Following the lead of *Nature*[^1] and other major publishers[^2], *A Cosmology Group* will **not accept** 'generative AI' tool as a credited author
on a research paper, nor as a participant on [`a-cosmology-group/discussions`](https://github.com/orgs/a-cosmology-group/discussions).

'Generative AI' produces patterns of words based on statistical correlations in their training data and in the text provided by users, producing
and output that appears like normal language but that may contain fundamental errors.  Furthermore, 'language models' cannot provide references
for their output, which is counter to the principles of scientific research.[^3]
