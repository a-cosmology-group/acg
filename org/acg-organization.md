# A Cosmology Group - Organization

## ACG Discussion Groups

### A Cosmology Group on *github.com*

Anyone with an interest in cosmology can read the discussions on [`a-cosmology-group/discussions`](https://github.com/orgs/a-cosmology-group/discussions).

With a GitHub account (free), contributors can post to the forum and add pages to the Group's documentation website.

Discussions are not moderated, but are subject to the '[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/a-cosmology-group/acg/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)' and '[Guidelines](https://github.com/a-cosmology-group/acg/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md)'.


### Cosmology Group on *Gaggle.email*

If you wish to join the Gaggle.email mailing list, please send a request to [Contacts](#contacts).  You will receive a confirmation email and a link to access your member's profile.

The mailing list [cosmology@gaggle.email](mailto:cosmology@gaggle.email) is for researchers with established credibility or excellent credentials related to cosmology.

The mailing list mostly used for posting links to new published work.  The list is moderated to reduce the number of messages.
