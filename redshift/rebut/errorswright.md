The oft-cited and highly-ranked "Errors in Tired Light Cosmology" [blog post](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/tiredlit.htm) (2008) by Edward L. Wright is an inaccurate critique of the tired light hypothesis.

The errors in "Errors in Tired Light Cosmology" prolong the crisis in cosmology and must be dispelled.

> Tired light models invoke a gradual energy loss by photons as they travel through the cosmos to produce the redshift-distance law.

Tired light models do not *invoke*, they *hypothesize* a gradual energy loss by photons as they travel intergalactic space to produce the redshift-distance trend.

> This has three main problems: There is no known interaction that can degrade a photon's energy without also changing its momentum, which leads to a blurring of distant objects which is not observed. The Compton shift in particular does not work.

The argument that "There is no known interaction that can degrade a photon's energy and avoid blurring" is false. There are interactions that avoid blurring including gravitational redshift, magnetic redshift, and the redshift of a photon reflecting off a mirror.

Where is the author's proof that redshift without blurring is an impossibility?

It must also be noted what a lack of feeling for exploration big bang cosmologists have, for them to think that no known interaction for a new phenomenon would mean that there couldn't be a new one. An idea like tired light is precious and should have been nurtured. Its suppression by big bang cosmologists is a stain in the history of science.

Also, there exists the phenomenon of dispersion (dispersion measure, dispersion slope), where photons arrive delayed depending on the intergalactic medium (column of electrons, ions, and magnetic field), and evidently, galaxies are not blurred. It is known that photons can pass through a column of electrons without blurring.

> The tired light model does not predict the observed time dilation of high redshift supernova light curves.

The study that claimed time dilation of high redshift supernova light curves might have subtle errors due to calibration of the light curves (SALT2 calibration).

The study might also have subtle errors because its claim requires the 'dubious' and 'disturbing' (choice words of Edwin Hubble) assumption that the red-shifts are velocity-shifts. It cannot be forgotten how absurd the theories of superluminal galactic recession and space expansion are. Dogma like "the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you" is not valid when the history of science shows many an absurd theory to be false and many a true theory to be not absurd but grand.

> The tired light model can not produce a blackbody spectrum for the Cosmic Microwave Background without some incredible coincidences.

This falsely assumes that tired light has to explain the CMB.

First, a cosmic microwave background was predicted before the proposal of the Big Bang Theory and [long before](https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~assis/Apeiron-V2-p79-84(1995).pdf) the observations of Penzias and Wilson.

Second, the source of the cosmic microwave background has not been proven to be some large fraction of the universe circumference (> 10 Gly) away from the Milky Way. There remains a possibility the CMB-emitter is nearer and does not experience significant redshift.

> Thus in the tired light model the energy of the CMB photons will go down but the density will not go down to match the density of a cooler blackbody.

There is 
- a false assumption that the CMB photons were emitted > 10 Gly away, and thus 
- a false premise that tired light has to explain it, and thus 
- a farce accusation that it can't.

> The local Universe is transparent and has a wide range of temperatures, so it does not produce a blackbody, which requires an isothermal absorbing situation. 

This is not proven. The local universe could be isothermally absorbing, transparent, and produce a perfect 2.7K spectrum.

Where is the author's proof that the local universe cannot have a 2.7K-microwave-emitter that does not impede other frequency photons?

> So the CMB must have come from a far away part of the Universe

This is not true and is based on a false rejection of the idea that the CMB-emitter could be somewhere closer, such as the 100-Mly-radius volume surrounding the Milky Way.

> The tired light model fails the Tolman surface brightness test

The tired light model does not. The studies arguing otherwise suffer from biases including Malmquist bias (instrument-sensitivity-floor leading to biased detection of brighter objects) and expanding-universe-hypothesis-calibrated-time-dilation-factor-inserted distance data.
