# [ΛCDM and Static Cosmology](cosmology-calculators.html)
**by Louis Marmet**

Recent observations by the Webb Telescope (JWST) have shown a large number of galaxies at high redshifts.  Contrary to expectations based on galaxy-formation models and the Standard Model of Cosmology (ΛCDM), these galaxies appear small and very bright.

The Hubble constant derived from the expansion rate of the local universe is in tension with the value derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) released by the hot Big Bang.  This "Hubble tension" is forcing cosmologists to question every aspect of the ΛCDM model.

This webpage hosts two [Cosmology Calculators](cosmology-calculators.html): one for the ΛCDM model, the other for a Static Cosmology with Stimulated-Transfer redshift (SSTz).
