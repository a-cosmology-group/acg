- CMB alignments and the 'Axis of evil' [inconsistent with a random isotropic sky](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608318)
- the dipole anisotropy in the [number of radio galaxies](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/04/031/meta) which appears larger than that of the CMB
- CMB that appears to originate [from intergalactic dust](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty974)

This article is updated with the publications of new results.

###  Dark Energy is not seen by the 'Dark Energy Survey'

- The analysis results in a 2.4σ tension with the DES Y1 3x2pt results, and in 5.6σ with the Planck CMB analysis; [`arXiv:2002.11124`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11124).

### The Hubble tension: disagreement at 4σ significance

- There is a tension between the Hubble value predicted from the cosmological model using measurements of the early Universe, and the value more directly measured from the late Universe; [`arXiv:2001.03624`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03624).

### Axis of Evil

- Multipoles of the CMB are aligned with the solar system.

- Anomalies in the CMB (alignment quadrupole/octopole, insufficient lens effect in clusters, etc.)

### CMBR: The σ<sub>8</sub> tension

- A problem of the ΛCDM model is the tension between the relatively high level of clustering, as quantified by the parameter σ<sub>8</sub>, found in cosmic microwave background experiments and the smaller one obtained from large-scale observations in the late Universe; [inspirehep.net/record/1657482](https://inspirehep.net/record/1657482). The tension between KiDS cosmic shear and the Planck-Legacy CMB measurements remains in this systematically more robust analysis, with S<sub>8</sub> differing by 2.3σ; [aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/01/aa34878-18/aa34878-18.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/01/aa34878-18/aa34878-18.html).

- Reionization epoch different from CMBR and QSO observations.

### Dark matter is not observed in the laboratory

- The exotic, weakly interacting particles envisaged as candidates for the dark matter component are still undetected in the laboratory

- Discovery of baryonic matter with more sensitive instruments decreases the needed amount of dark matter.  The estimated amount of dark matter in the Coma cluster is now a factor of 4 to 5 larger than baryonic matter.  Due to the discovery of hot gas in rich galaxy clusters it is ∼100 less than when Zwicky first discovered it.

- The "Train Wreck" Cluster, Abell 520, is not understood in Standard Cosmology; https://darkmattercrisis.wordpress.com/2010/08/11/the-train-wreck-cluster-an-anti-bullet-cluster-disproof-of-cold-or-warm-dark-matter/; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...668..806M/abstract; https://darkmattercrisis.wordpress.com/.

### Matter-antimatter asymmetry

- There is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the baryon asymmetry problem. There is no observation of antimatter or evidence for CP violation.

  The gap between prediction and observation is attributed to an unknown process that produced baryon number non-conservation - more baryons than anti-baryons.  Such processes have never been observed in any experiments on earth.

  Any such processes would necessarily imply a finite lifetime for the proton of about 10<sup>30</sup> years, as originally predicted by Georgi, Quinn and Weinberg, as a necessary condition for resolving the antimatter problem. As experiments ruled out longer and longer lifetimes, these Grand Unified Theories theories were modified to predict longer lifetimes.  However, to date observations have ruled out a lifetime even 10<sup>4</sup> times larger excluding all these theories.  There is no experimental evidence of a finite lifetime for the proton.  But the lack of such a finite lifetime would rule out the baryon number non-conservation needed to overcome the 10<sup>11</sup>-fold gap between Big Bang baryon density predictions and observations.  The inconsistency between prediction and observation still exists.

### Missing Baryon problem

- The observed amount of baryonic matter does not match theoretical predictions, yielding about 50% of the expected baryonic density.  There is not enough matter to produce large galaxies in a time period not exceeding the age of the universe. "*Hot baryons within the virial radius of massive galaxy halos are insufficient to explain the ''missing baryons.''* " [ApJL 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aab2af/meta).

- Intergalactic medium temperature independent of redshift; [`arXiv:1009.0953`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0953).

- Quasars don't show time dilation with redshift; "Time Dilation and Quasar Variability," The Astrophysical Journal Letters **553**, No. 2, L97, 2010, <http://stacks.iop.org/1538-4357/553/i=2/a=L97>, [`arXiv:astro-ph/0105073`](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105073).

  > This work is often dismissed by citing a paper published two years later which claims to show time dilation in quasar light curves \["Using quasars as standard clocks for measuring cosmological redshift," [Phys. Rev. Lett 108, 231302](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.231302), 2012, [`arXiv:1204.5191`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5191)\]. However, the paper is not convincing for the following reasons.
  >
  > The luminous flux of quasars is analyzed manually: "We pick several straight line light curve segments \[...\] for more reliable identification (or rejection) of the observed patterns.  \[...\]  We identify five segments from its light curve that appear straight \[...\]  We take each of those segments, discarding the rest of the light curve \[...\]"  No criterion is given on how to pick the segments.  No rejection criterion is given concerning the patterns.  No objective definition of "appear straight" is given.  There is also no mention of the fraction of the data that was discarded.  Since the light curves patterns are never straight, this procedure is completely subjective and prone to cherry picking.
  >
  > Before they are overlapped and compared, light curves are normalized with three parameters: time offset, flux normalization and the time dilation factor.  However, no justification is given for a possible flux normalization by a negative factor.  The authors show that they can obtain a good match from only one pair of light curves (where they use this negative factor), but they fail to show that the choice of other possible parameters would never produce good matches.
  >
  > This subjective approach does not offer the robustness of a formal analysis.  Although this work is cited in arguments against the absence of time dilation, it does not convincingly show time dilation in quasar light curves.

### Surface-Brightness measurements are explained with galactic size evolution

- Galaxies must increase in size at a rate larger than allowed by galaxy mergers.

- The extreme evolution of galaxy sizes is poorly understood.

### Failure to detect the Transverse Proximity Effect with a foreground quasar

- Contrived explanations are necessary to explain the absence of a transverse proximity effect in hundreds of observations of projected quasar pairs; [`arXiv:0809.2277`](https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2277) and [`arXiv:1809.04614`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04614).  Observations are explained if QSOs have had their current UV luminosities for less than approximately a million years (coincidentally, we always observe just after an increase of the UV luminosity), or an anisotropic emission from a QSO located within an obscuring torus of gas and dust (always conveniently producing a very narrow emission angle).

### Large-Scale structures are too large

- The universe is inhomogeneous at a scale incompatible with the smooth and homogeneous beginning implied by the Big Bang theory.

- Flows of large-scale structure matter with excessive velocity.

- Inhomogeneities at scales \> 200 Mpc.

### The faint blue galaxy problem

- Deeper observations show a great excess of faint galaxies.  Most F.B.G.s appear between red-shift 0.5 and 2. It is believed that they disappear as separate objects by merger with other galaxies; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_blue_galaxy>.

### ULAS J1342+0928

ULAS J1342+0928 is the most distant known quasar detected and contains the most distant and oldest known supermassive black hole. The quasar is one of many which challenges theories of black hole formation by having a supermassive black hole much larger than expected at such an early stage in the Universe's history; https://phys.org/news/2017-05-discovery-early-universe-poses-black.html.

- The inclusion of a cosmological constant means that the ratio of the vacuum energy density to the radiation energy density after inflation is 1 part in 10<sup>100</sup>, a fine-tuning coincidence which leads to appeals to the anthropic principle for an explanation.

- Even if fine-tuning arguments are regarded as unsatisfactory, the problem is that inflation was set up to get rid of fine-tuning in terms of the “flatness” problem and so the introduction of more fine-tuning with the cosmological constant appears circular.

- Astrophysically, any cold-dark-matter (CDM) model in the first instance predicts a featureless mass function for galaxies, whereas the galaxy luminosity function shows a sharp “knee”.

- CDM models predict that large structures should form last and therefore should be young whereas, observationally, the largest galaxies and clusters appear old.

- To fix the above two problems, large amounts of feedback are invoked which results in more energy being used to prevent stars forming early than in forming them under gravity at later times.
